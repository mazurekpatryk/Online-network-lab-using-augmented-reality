# Online network lab using augmented reality
The project of an application supporting the process of education in computer network classes on the issue of building a server rack. There are three modes in the application: build, delete and the last mode manages the doors and covers of the server rack. The application was created using the Unity graphic engine. Scripts were written in C#. 3D objects were created in 3ds Max. The application is designed for Magic Leap 1. The programme can be used during remote learning when it is not possible to work on the actual server rack and network devices.
